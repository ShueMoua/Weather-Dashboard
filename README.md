Weather-Dashboard

Description: 
This app will provide you with the current temperature, humidity, wind, and UV for the city you search for. It will also display the temperature for the next 5 days.

Build:
This app was built using bootstrap for the css, and AJAX in the Javascript. The weather data is pulled from the openweather API.

How To Use:
You type the city you want the weather for in the search bar; after you click on the search button, the weather for that city will appear, and a button for the city will appear below the search bar so you could find previous results.

All your results will be stored so if you refresh the page, your previous results will still be there.
